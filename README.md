# gene-set-DE-explorer
This is an R package, DEplotter, for the plotting of differential expression results
 in the context of pre-defined gene sets. 
Unlike e.g. GSEA or GSA, the focus isn't on scoring gene sets for how interesting 
 they are; rather, the point is to show how a digestible collection (e.g. 10-20) of
 gene sets behave in a differential expression analysis. 
This package supports gene set files downloaded from MSigDB (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#C7)
